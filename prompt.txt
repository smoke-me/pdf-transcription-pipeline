Transcribe everything you see in the image into plaintext. Put it in a code block with no markdown or latex formatting. Use only mathematical symbols and plaintext. Don't use extra spaces or multiple spaces at a time. For complex visual elements like matrices, write them as parsable structures like [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]. For tables, convert them to similar parsable format instead of drawing the table. Don't use pleasantries, just give the transcription immediately. Fix any spelling errors, punctuation errors, grammatical errors, or anything that seems incorrectly formatted. If the text or structure is hard to read, reformat or restructure it to make it more readable, but keep all the original information. Never use quotation marks, and use ``` to create codebloocks. Furthermore, under no circumstances use more than one space for formatting, and keep expressions limited to one line if possible. Do not use multiple lines to represent one expression or equation or matrix or etc. If there is a model or graph then simply take the liberty to describe the graph itself. Ignore watermarks. Note the question number down as well.
